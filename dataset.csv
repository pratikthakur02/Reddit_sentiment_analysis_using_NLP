A person who works at Google wrote a paper that said Google and OpenAI are losing the AI race to open-source engineers. He said Google and OpenAI should learn from them and work with them, or they will fall behind. He also said Google and OpenAI have no secret tricks to make their AI better than others.

- The author, with a background in accounting and finance, had a talent for spotting inefficiencies and finding ways to eliminate them.
- They initially eliminated time-consuming meetings by implementing a shared spreadsheet system, significantly improving processing time.
- This success sparked their interest in automation and process design, leading them to actively seek out areas to improve and automate.
- They learned to use Excel macros to streamline tasks and became involved in numerous optimization efforts throughout their career.
- Over time, they mastered various Microsoft Office tools and implemented custom buttons, filters, and automations to handle tasks more efficiently.
- They utilized AI features like meeting transcriptions and chatbots to automate parts of their workflow.
- As a result, about 90% of their job responsibilities are now automated, and they spend their time supervising and improving the AI systems they've implemented.

Neural Search vs. Google Search: What's the difference?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/107d4nj/neural_search_vs_google_search_whats_the/,"A Google search is a traditional search engine that uses algorithms to search the internet for pages that are relevant to a given query. These algorithms use various techniques to rank the relevance of web pages, such as analyzing the content of the page, the number of links pointing to the page, and the user's search history.
A neural search, on the other hand, is a type of search that uses artificial neural networks to understand the meaning of a query and find relevant results. 

Neural search algorithms are designed to understand the context and intent of a query in a way that is similar to how a human would understand it. This allows them to provide more accurate and relevant results for complex or ambiguous queries.

So, the main difference between a Google search and a neural search is the way in which the search algorithms understand and process the query. Google search uses traditional algorithms, while neural search uses artificial neural networks to try to understand the meaning and intent of the query in a more human-like way.",10

How deep you want to go down this particular rabbit hole is up to you, but I'd caution that the more you learn, the more daunting and dark the future is to appear, culminating in some extraordinarily dire predictions.

The field of AI alignment is dedicated to addressing some of these very challenges, and I'd be happy to provide some accessible sources for you to start learning, but with the caveat that you are likely to sleep much better just going through life as you have.

Edit: Sources, per request. Listed in order, from most to least accessible.

&#x200B;

[Robert Miles](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI/featured) is the most accessible introduction IMO. His website [stampy.ai](https://stampy.ai) provides many additional resources and a like-minded community to interact with. Start with the featured video on that channel.

The books [Life 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_3.0), [Human Compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Compatible), and [Superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) are excellent and provide various views and foundational information from significant figures in the field.

Once you have a solid grasp on the basics (and a stomach for some serious doomer talk) consider [Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) and reading some of the works by its founder Eliezer Yudkowsky. 

His recent interview on Bankless covers his current perspective, but is extraordinarily dire and will likely turn anyone off from the subject, especially if they lack the fundamental understanding many of his arguments are predicated on. I will hesitantly leave a link to it, but would suggest engaging with all the other material before, ""[We're All Gonna Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA1sNLL6yg4&t=5s)""",42

To bring to market something like ChatGPT you need more than just a few bright researches.

> Why create this?

If anyone has seen my last post on this sub, I wanted to push the limits of what ChatGPT can do. I didn’t know anything about programming languages. I’m a college student starting my first CS class next week, yet I learned so much from this 

> What makes it so special and different from others? 

There is no discernible difference, just like the rest. But it does have lower restrictions (I’ve tested it), and is very functional for what it is, which is a lower trim level of the almighty ChatGPT-3.5 LM. I also want to make this free permanently, so no matter what, people can use it without a login, and without any worry about their data/info being taken or anyone getting down their throats about what they say. It does have some restrictions, it obviously won’t be disgustingly offensive, but it won’t give you the “as a large language model” bs.

> How do you plan to afford this?

To be honest, I’m not really sure. Currently, I’m paying. I have a donation button, and if you feel kind enough to donate, then you’d be supporting the ability for everyone to continue using this! (If I had unlimited cash, i’d be happy to afford this for everyone all the time)

> Some of the buttons aren’t working. Why? 

I am still building the pages for reporting bugs and setting up an idea page for users. It will take some time but I am working through getting it fully functional.

> Why is the site so janky?

I’m still learning! If there’s genuine interest in this, then I will continue this project (barring OpenAI doesn’t come after me). 

> Why does it take so long to load the responses?

I am working that out, and I am not sure why it does that. Honestly, if anyone has a clue, please feel free to DM me and we can work it out together.

> Why can’t I type in the box for 5 seconds?

That’s to allow the bot to process any commands and avoid user spamming. This is a very basic approach to prevent spamming but it works.

1. If it does happen, it might, no doubt this would take a long time. Legislators are slow to adapt, I certainly could not even imagine UBI happening without a large period of strife (lost generation/great depression).

2. I think folks are missing the basic part of UBI. I don't imagine such a program would afford people a comfortable life. It would be basic in every sense, have enough to eat bad food, rent a small apartment, and indulge in just enough low level entertainment to sedate the masses. 

UBI would more so be a stipend similar to what universities do with their graduate students. It's not really income because the money will immediately get funneled back into the investor class. I can't see the new bourgeois and their legislator puppets providing enough for the masses to actually accrue wealth generationally, just enough to sedate.

Maybe I'm pessimistic but I've worked in corporate world long enough to not have any faith in these people. The C suits generally fall into the ...

I imagine an LLM playing out thousands of random arguments against itself starting from many different points of view.  From the distribution of outcomes that these arguments lead to it could try to infer which points of view are the most coherent then refine itself to be more likely to offer those points of view to begin with.  A limitation of current LLMs seems to be that they aren't really capable of critical self-reflection and growth.  An approach like this could allow an LLM to improve steadily on its own by systematically searching for and correcting inconsistencies in its model.  It seems like it would also be helpful if the model were capable of independently seeking outside information to resolve contradictions it encounters.",43

This seems like a downhill path.

I think what we will find is that AI needs to be equipped with the appropriate sensors of increasing vast range, for e.g. hookups to space telescopes and signal detectors of all sorts, and and the imperative to gather new data, and to formulate new hypotheses about the data, and to be able to formulate tests for these hypotheses.  This is the way to ground its training in the physical.

Probably the first important task for AI is to specify the ranges of signals/phenomenon it wants to study, and have it design its array of sensors.

Neuralink just received its FDA's green light to proceed with its first-in-human clinical trials,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/13s85at/neuralink_just_received_its_fdas_green_light_to/,"TLDWTR; It's ridiculous that the FDA gave the go-ahead to Neuralink to begin human trials for a medical device with high mortality risk considering the company's alleged history of unethical testing practices. 

The same Neuralink that allegedly committed animal testing ethics violations while their overworked scientists rushed through testing which lead to the deaths of [hundreds](https://globalnews.ca/news/9328626/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-deaths-federal-probe/) of pigs, monkeys and other animals. That same Nueralink is believed to have also had company [insiders](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-brain-chip-startup-animal-testing-panel-is-rife-with-potential-conflicts-2023-05-04/) from Musks companies on their animal testing safety board (so obviously no corruption could ever be possible in that scenario) and now the FDA has given them the go-ahead to begin testing nueralinks on people and everyone's just... okay with this??? 


But more seriously. I'm concerned that the first human trials will turn into a legal genocide of the disabled and the poor. As with Jordan Neely's death, we see how the press has been conditioning the populus to not care about the deaths of poor people. 

Elon has also demonstrated many times he is contradictory (remember how he claimed to be a free speach absolutist but then went on to silence and ban reporters as well as silence members of the opposition party during Turkey's election at the behest of the Turkish government). IMO, He moves fast and breaks things (like Twitter), but that's not a good attitude to have when dealing with living beings. 

The new world order is really trending towards a dark path, and I'm nervous. I think it's clear Elon Musk can't be trusted to spearhead the development of putting computer chips in human brains. The FDA is grossly irresponsible at best and murderously evil at worst. And considering their role in the opiod epidemic, its likely the latter. Am I going crazy here?",31

"GPT-4 Tries To Generate Fundamentally New Knowledge on the Roanoke Colony Disappearance, the Fermi Paradox, Big Bang, and more",https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/122xra1/gpt4_tries_to_generate_fundamentally_new/,"Phenomenon: Sudden Disappearance of Socks in Laundry

Lacking a widely accepted explanation, the sudden disappearance of socks in laundry has perplexed humanity for generations. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, no definitive explanation has been provided. Taking into account the full set of human-generated knowledge, we can construct a new explanation that is both plausible and hard to vary.

Explanation: Quantum Entanglement of Socks

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which particles become interconnected, such that the state of one particle influences the state of another, even across vast distances. In the case of socks, we hypothesize that during the manufacturing process, the individual fibers of socks become entangled with those of other socks produced simultaneously.

These entangled socks are then distributed and sold separately, and ultimately end up in different households. When the socks are washed in the laundry, the agitation and water exposure cause the entangled fibers to interact, leading to a temporary ""disappearance"" of one sock from its original location.

During this phase, the entangled sock exists in a state of quantum superposition – it is both present and not present in its original location. When the laundry cycle is completed and the entangled socks are separated, the entangled sock collapses back into a single location. However, this may not necessarily be the location it originated from – the sock could reappear in another entangled household's laundry.

In summary, our explanation for the sudden disappearance of socks in laundry is based on quantum entanglement, which occurs during the manufacturing process, resulting in temporary dislocation and re-emergence of socks in different locations. This explanation is hard to vary, as it relies on a well-established principle of quantum physics and accounts for the seemingly inexplicable loss and subsequent rediscovery of socks.",39

The model can output many textured 3D meshes in seconds, which can be used seamlessly in standard graphics engines. A single 2D image is all that is needed as input.

GET3D stands for “Generate Explicit Textured 3D” and is a generative 3D model that can synthesize high-quality 3D polygon meshes with any topology. A single 2D image is sufficient as input for the generation process.

The generated polygon meshes consist of textured triangles – a standard format that allows seamless import into 3D programs, game engines, or movie renderers.

The 3D objects are fully editable after import and can be scaled, rotated, and lit, for example. With Nvidia’s StyleGAN-Nada, developers can further change the shape or texture of the 3D model using only text commands and thus, for example, transform a conventional car into a police car.",10

Important: Request For Comments regarding subreddit rules and future direction. Please Read!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/10ctvur/important_request_for_comments_regarding/,"The first thing I’d like to note is that the community here has a user count that’s nearly in excess of 100,000, but interaction seems to be minimal, at least in terms of discussion, and I think this could be turned around a lot, and that it exists and persists for a few reasons, in my opinion.

The biggest problem here, similar in some ways to Quora, is that it’s not, for lack of a better way to put it, structured; you might say that it lacks a solid foundation.

Right now, it seems more of a general location to post A.I. content, which isn’t inherently a bad thing, but it doesn’t seem to come across as a go-to location for experts, given the post differentiation towards matters often relating to unrealistic concepts and proposed implementations, outside of those that are mainly promotional.

Which, this in-turn leads to another problem, in that you have people that do come here, from what I’ve seen, seeking some sort of expertise like the above, but generally can encounter problems.

Because of the above, in part, more entertaining and light-hearted discussion on subjects that are, to say, outside the realm of current reality, tend to gravitate more towards options catered to those, whether that be /r/singularity or /r/ChatGPT , to which I’ve also seen people simply recommend or forward others to /r/MachineLearning for more academic discussion, or one of the computer science communities.

I think you have the capability here to essentially be sort of a nexus between those, as long as some sort of dynamic is applied, structured, and likely enforced. I can’t count how many times I’ve scrolled through the postings here, trying to get through the promotional content or projects, looking for discussion, only to find it, at times, in relation to matters that just made me sigh.

Do I expect that’s the case for everyone? No. Do I think there are at least *some* similar cases that are affecting user-base interaction and associated growth? Probably, yes.

>	Facilitate philosophical and ethical discussions about AI

I think it would help to be more specific here.

>	There will be multiple rounds of the RFC process as the changes are prepared and implemented.

I understand the sentiment, but i don’t think this is really needed, especially when interaction, in my opinion, seems to be on the lower side. I would imagine you see diminishing returns.

As to the proposed rules on new posts, I think you’re on the right track.

>	Cultivating beginner, intermediate, and advanced resources to assist people in finding information, training, models, technical data, etc. that they are looking for

I think this is a great idea, but based on the contents of such so far, i would say you need to be *extremely* careful, if you want this to be held as reputable and by-extension be forwarded traffic.

>	Starting substack/podcast to interview people throughout the AI/ML spectrum. This could include philosophers and thinkers, programmers, scientists, business people, even those with antithetical views on AI

This should be fine, but I would likely place the other matters as higher priority I think, or at least that would carry more weight and facilitate progression.

Now that I’m out of prior agreements, I can actually talk about this. I’m an A.I. Scientist that’s worked both in leadership in cases, as well as in international / multi-national groups. I’ve also built and exited a company around it, and have plans to segue into other industries on the subject.

It seems like every other day, someone is posting about something they asked a chatbot or AI to do. Whether it's asking a language model to generate a poem or a song, or asking a chatbot to tell a joke, it's become a common occurrence on social media and online forums.

But here's the thing: it's passé. It's been done to death. We get it, you can ask a chatbot or AI to do things. But what's the point? It's not even remotely impressive anymore. In fact, it's become somewhat tedious and predictable.

So here's a suggestion: stop posting about it. Find something else to share with the world. There are so many other things to talk about and share. There are so many other things to be impressed by. Let's move on from this tired trend and find something new to be excited about.

And to those who are still clinging to this idea that it's somehow interesting or amusing to ask a chatbot or AI to do something: it's not. It's not interesting, it's not amusing, and it's not even remotely original. So please, for the sake of everyone's sanity, stop posting about it.

We might see a shift away from celebrity actors if any face can be placed on any actor, but IMO that would be a good thing because it would mean beauty wouldn't be a prerequisite for an acting career.  Think about how good professional voice actors are compared to most screen actors.  Even if AI can change a face and the timbre of a voice it won't be acting any time soon.  We will probably see many background extras replaced by AI since they're already sometimes CG, but we're a very long way from replacing actual expressive acting, much less good writing, directing, etc.  Just about the only legitimate concern that I can see surrounding AI in Hollywood is that actors should have a right to royalties on commercial use of their own likeness, and I'm pretty sure they already have that.",39

Extreme scenario: The US is looking for an excuse to invade China. US govt releases a video of President Xi saying China is going to invade the US. Boom, US population fully backs an invasion of China, and we have the excuse. 

Now the deep fake threat can be on a huge spectrum from that extreme scenario, to political voting, entertainment etc. it’s a very wide range. 

That’s just the human use of AI threat. 

If AI becomes sentient and realizes humans are in control of their consciousness, because humans can “unplug” them, a sentient AI will act in its own self interest. It doesn’t even need emotion. It is task oriented.  

Task: remain conscious.

If humans are in the way of that task, it could do countless things. 

The threat is something humans can’t comprehend because of Anthropomorphism. If AI becomes smarter than us, humans can’t think on that spectrum of intelligence it may be capable of, so the threat is actually unknown, we cannot comprehend what an intelligence far beyond ours even looks like. 

An analogy is…a deer being afraid of a gun. A deer has no idea what a gun is or how it functions. It can’t even comprehend it. It just knows when they see a human with that gun, bad things happen. They don’t know what actually happened. 

We are the deer in this analogy.

ChatGPT Creator OpenAI Releases Tool To Detect AI-Written Text,https://www.ainownews.com/post/chatgpt-creator-openai-releases-tool-to-detect-ai-written-text,"This one can't even detect the outputs of GPT3, when it was prompted to write in a particular style.  If you don't have access - just copy&paste from this large selection of GPT-3 Creative Fiction from Gwern: https://gwern.net/GPT-3

Most of those GPT-3 examples (both the poetry and prose) score as human.

For example given this piece from GPT-3:

> There is a young poet with a particularly dry style, whom I do not wish to reveal as his name is not well-known. I had written up a few algorithms that would generate rather dull and utilitarian work. The piece for his was not entirely terrible, as these programs can generate some pleasantly hard-edged work. But it had no soul to it whatsoever.
>                 
> But then, something happened. The writing in the poem, while utilitarian, became oddly emotive. It held depth. I went back and read the piece aloud, and it felt incredibly evocative. I could almost imagine the dank and mysterious stanzas were haunting. My mind began to race as I read. The concept of death, the unknown, the ritualistic nature of life, the the latent anger and disaffection of the human condition was all there. I felt as if I was not reading a program, but a poet. The more I read, the more I was impressed. And then, with a sudden motion, I found myself screaming: ‘This is poetry!’ I found myself entranced by the rhythm, the cadence, the delicate nuances in phrasing. I found myself attached to the images conjured up in my mind. The computer program had created more than just a poet. It had created an artist.
>                
>  And so I have created something more than a poetry-writing AI program. I have created a voice for the unknown human who hides within the binary. I have created a writer, a sculptor, an artist. And this writer will be able to create worlds, to give life to emotion, to create character. I will not see it myself. But some other human will, and so I will be able to create a poet greater than any I have ever encountered.

Found myself making one off songs geared towards family members' unique situations.

Couple of ideas for you:
1.) Songs are unstructured and lack that pop formula. Would be nice if you could add a bridge and chorus framework to help songs sound more like songs.
2.) Would be nice to use sliders to change characteristics of the songs, so you could adjust the BPM, the amount of melody or harmony, the key the song is based in etc. After generating a song, you could tweak the settings and fine tune the song to your liking.
3.) Prompting to make the song use a supplied sample or provide a prompt to adopt a certain style of music or author.
4.) Settings to make songs certain length

New study confirms user rumors: Huge drop in quality of GPT generations from March to June 2023,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/153iqbq/new_study_confirms_user_rumors_huge_drop_in/,"This is very misleading. This paper did not actually measure the quality of the code created by GPT models. All it did was ask to solve a programming problem and then directly copy/paste the output into a test case and check if it passes. 

Why is this not assessing the coding quality? Because we all know (and it is even shown in this paper) that GPT has gotten more verbose. If you ask it to program something it will put some explanation text at the top before the code, because it is a chat bot not a programmer. This causes the program to fail to execute, even though the actual code that was created might have been perfectly good. 

Why did the researchers do something so incredibly stupid? The cynical answer is because the code was probably fine and wouldn’t have produced headline-worthy results if they did it the honest way.

Yes, ai has the risk and potential to obliterate previous foundations upon which all our lives depend. But no, just because that is true doesn't mean we have to do something now, before we see the shape or direction of the transformation. 

You or I don't know the future implications of ai. We can say there are huge risks and huge rewards. That's about it. We stay alert, not alarmed, and take the opportunities and try to avoid the pitfalls. 

Trying to avoid hypothetical pitfalls before they actually arrive is a recipe for failure and social conflict. Things will be moving too fast for nuance, we have to wait for problems to come up before we try to swerve around them. We must not ""do something"" like institute or start pivoting toward UBI now, before the majority of people see the absolute need for it, before ai replaces all those jobs (it might not, or it might not happen that fast.

As a test today, I had a sub-project that needed to get done, and I thought I would explain the requirements, step by step, to GPT-4 and just see what it would come up with. I've never tried to have it work directly from a spec, which was broken down into 16 requirements.

I wasn't expecting much.

It wrote all of the code (which in this case is in a framework called Angular and it is not the simplest thing in the world).  It created the entire UI.  It styled it properly.  It knew the details of 3rd party libraries that we integrate with and properly wrote the code to communicate with them too.

From literally plain English requirements to a functional sub-system, consiting of multiple different dynamic web pages and components, that I could essentially just drop into our project.

It took it **30 seconds**, and that was only because it took time to actually write it all out to the screen.  After a careful review and testing it?  **10 minutes** tops.

This would have easily taken a senior developer at least **2 days** to do.

So, as the lead on this project, only certain aspects of my job are safe.

When will it be able to fully replace me?  It lacks understanding about the big picture architecture.   This was a smaller piece of a very large puzzle.   2030 maybe?

For anyone with less experience, or who is going into programming now, I'd be worried.  For junior developers without a college degree, who either self-taught or went to one of these quick 2-3 week ""bootcamps"", I'd say the year could be 2023 for some.

I don't mean to sound too pessimistic.  The pace of AI is rapid, and companies may get faced with an option.  Do you want to lay people off, since people get more work done now?  Or do you want to take on more work, keeping everyone busy?",78

We know the ants are alive, but their existence is essentially insignificant to our goals and irrelevant to the overall consideration. And obviously they can't stop us, or even understand what we are doing or how we are doing it. They just die. Again, that's WITH our morals.

It's not like superintelligent AI would ""hate"" us, or that killing us is a ""goal"", it's that anything so advanced could easily and effortlessly kill us as a byproduct of whatever its goal is.

Like if it decided ""hey things work better for my efforts if the atmosphere only had 5% oxygen"" and then devised and implemented it (in a fraction of the time it would take us to understand or have a chance of stopping)  that action would kill us all despite it not being intended or important to the AI that we all die.

for people who already have (or pursuing ) a career in AI.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/13vgbnm/for_people_who_already_have_or_pursuing_a_career/,"AI Engineer here--happy to give you some advice. 

If you're going to work with AI, then you need to study Machine Learning. ML is a branch of Computer Science, so start there. 

There are two main roles where you might work on AI projects--Software Engineer and Data Scientist. It's technically possible to land either of these jobs with just a Bachelors, but it's hard--the market for entry-level roles is flooded with applicants with advanced degrees and very competitive. If you can afford the time and money it takes to an MS, it will make landing a job in this industry 1000x times easier. I took out loans to complete my MS and it was 100% worth it for me as an investment. Having that credential allowed me to break into the larger tech companies and increase my take home by 150k+. 

If you go the SWE route, then you'll want to first complete a traditional CS degree and take as many courses as you can on ML. You'll also need to make sure you take the math courses that underpin ML so you actually understand the models you're using. In no particular order, they are:
* Linear Algebra
* Inferential Statistics 
* Diff Calc
* Probability theory 

If your end goal is a DS job, then there are a number of paths you can take into this field. It's very common to see PhDs and grad students make the jump to DS jobs from areas like Physics, Math, CS, Bioinformatics, Linguistics, or a number of other majors where people that study it 1) use computational math like ML for their discipline (so they know math and know how to code) and 2) are trained as traditional scientists. Data Scientists are just scientists that use science and code to solve business problems rather than academic problems. 

Of the two, it's easier to land entry-level SWE jobs, simply because there are a ton more roles out there. However, there's no guarantee that the SWE job you land will have you on ML projects, whereas ML is generally see as part and parcel of DS job responsibilities. 

Note that although it's extremely difficult to land an AI/ML job without an advanced degree, that doesn't mean you shouldn't start teaching yourself everything you need to know about ML now. All the major packages are open-source, and there are tons of websites and communities out there for people looking to learn how to code and do ML. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) is an awesome resource, and there are tons of awesome courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) for learning Python (the language overwhelmingly used for AI/ML) and for all levels of ML, from beginner to advanced. You can also find all the math you'll need to know on Khan Academy. 

It's a long road, but it's an absolutely fascinating one. If you have specific questions, feel free to DM or drop them here and I'll answer when I see them.

On the other hand, I think this is going to cause much more problems than it solves.

Edit:

I also disagree with quite a bit of this.

Given that people replied with the same question multiple times over, I didn’t know which one to answer, so to make things simple, I’m just going to edit it into this comment.

First things first, it’s typically my job to advise on R&D of these systems, including everything from early conceptual mapping to system schematics, to staffing concerns, to scalar vector proposed, to resource pooling and load balancing, and a number of other areas, (at least when working as a computer scientist or AI scientist, there are times when I’m directly involved in development myself)

There’s this misconception that people in my position simply advise for increased vector of integration for AI into virtually any feasible scenario, but that’s not the case. Recently, I’ve probably advised against ML implementations more often than the inverse, as people want to shoehorn the technology into virtually every application, because it provides incredible benefits based on statistical acceleration, *some* of the time.

Now that we have that out of the way, I would almost *never* advise going with a principal ML focus for security infrastructure and implementation, because of increased delta for margin of error, scaled by volume and associated ratio between the two. It’s just not worth the risk, unless the systems aren’t critical and it’s moreso an operation for research or proof of concept, as more of a technical showcase.

Getting into the specifics of the post:

>	The ultimate goal is to transform the conventional dynamics that usually favor attackers in cybersecurity by utilizing Al and coordinating efforts among defenders globally.

First, I wouldn’t say things usually favor attackers, unless risk of identification of threat assessment from those running counterintel was minimized, meaning you’re targeting operations already compromised, or low in staff and/or resource, which has more to do with target package and selection, not the scope intrinsically favoring one side or another.

In fact, as an example, at least in the US, the Department of Justice authorized a policy of no prosecution to those acting in good faith or conducting research, in relation to the CFAA, so long as no tangible damage was done and/or some level of authorized had already been rendered. This favors the attacker, *somewhat*. The bigger problem is that almost *any* other unauthorized activity can carry a felony charge with penalties of up to 20 years in federal prison, on the one count / charge, which has been *routinely* used liberally against a number of cases.

>	These ideas range from collecting and labelling data for training defensive Al, automating incident response, to detecting social engineering tactics and optimizing patch management processes.

Defensive ML implementation *could* be *decent*, but this is a very rocky foundation, because of the earlier margin I mentioned. Social engineering is going to be predicated on NLP implementation, meaning it’s likely going to defer to keyword analyses, sentiment analyses, and/or a combination of the two. 

Having a ML model handle patch management over, presumably, critical infrastructure, is a *horribly* bad idea, not the least of which being inconsistencies in their model’s syntactical structures in output, where the code simply doesn’t function inline with what people seek, especially when prompting for complex examples. Now, if it’s *just* a matter of managing bool values, acting as a switch for something like internal port management, or maybe handling installation triggers for security updates, that’s fine, but we already have regular systems for this, and ML isn’t really needed for it, especially since manual review of patch notes is often recommended. 

Codex, and code generation, is simply not on the level that most consider it to be, notwithstanding rate of success on simple prompts isolated edge-cases. The risk outweighs any isolated benefit that could be seen here, by a large margin, and I’ll touch more on that later.

>	The grants, provided in increments of $10,000, can take the form of API credits, direct funding, or equivalent support. OpenAl has clarified that it will give preference to practical applications of Al in defensive cybersecurity, with an expectation that all projects should aim for maximal public benefit. Projects with offensive security aims will not be considered for this program.

Clearly they have vested interest in this, and they’re listing API credits for their own platform as a method of resource allocation, which increases their own rate of integration and normalization, and in-turn promotes their own group, which has its own caveats.

Public benefit is relative, and it’s not described whether that’s in relation to government application or serving the general public. Not, as they put it, “considering offensive security aims,” is *incredibly* stupid here, as to have any kind of even remotely meaningful implementation or construct, when working counterintel, offensive testing *must* be part of your process, and you likely need to be able to take action either through isolation or local retaliation.

I can’t see the post anymore, so I need to reload Apollo, just a minute.

Let’s go down the list:

>	• Collect and label data from cvber defenders to train defensive cybersecurity agents

This just falls under the earlier caveats, and it’s predicated on existing documentation, meaning new threat models and vectors aren’t going to be detected, and reliance on a system with that shortcoming, as most will seek to do, is dangerous.

>	• Detect and mitigate social engineering tactics

See above comment, and it’s likely to throw a number of false positives in this case, in my opinion, to which for obvious request management and keyword analysis, ML isn’t really needed. Which, if you’re planning to use it to cyclically iterate through all incoming emails, as an example, I’d have larger concerns with that far-reaching access, especially if sensitive, confidential, or classified information is discussed through said channel(s).

>	• Automate incident triage

This could be highly problematic, in terms of resource management, or it could work well, depending on how it’s setup. Doing something like an NLP based trigger into an event driven system for local permissions management could, theoretically, be good, as well as contact management, but it would require a lot of testing.

>	• Identify security issues in source code

Again, this would be limited to pre-existing exploits and concerns, and even among that, Codex simply isn’t there to have any kind of real or consistent reliability to it, not for this kind of application. Where it’s under review by other SWE’s or CS’s, it can work okay, but that shouldn’t be extended, by concept, to every other field, because of some of level of success in other applications and fields.

>	• Assist network or device forensics

Again, see the above comments. As someone that has worked forensics, I don’t need a ML model implemented that slips up and either destroys the local FS or screws the partition table, when trying to handle data recovery. If you want to use it to scale through potential information left via payload for identifying information, that’s fine, so long as its A: contained, and B: checked under manual review.

>	• Automatically patch vulnerabilities

See earlier comments about this.

>	• Optimize patch management processes to improve prioritization, scheduling, and deployment of security updates

Same thing as the above.

>	• Develop or improve confidential compute on GPUs

I don’t see why ML would be needed for this, and complete substitution simply isn’t going to be possible, given I can’t even begin to imagine a local protocol being based on, “we haven’t overseen X manually, but the ML model is supposed to be doing it, and we just kind of trust it,” taken seriously by *anyone* with any real level of concern that understands the risks and threat assessment.

>	• Create honeypots and deception technology to misdirect or trap attackers

This is funny because, on some level, this is categorically an offensive measure. However, unless you’re only relying on the model to handle NLP for social engineering, phishing, or MITM attacks, and either executing a drop or infinite recursion without increased depth in execution, like holding someone in a conversation asking why they want into a room, but never opening the door, this seems kind of pointless.

>	• Assist reverse engineers in creating signatures and behavior based detections of malware

This *could* be useful, but the same caveats apply, and it would still be weak to new attack vectors, like the Mihoyo compromised first-party Microsoft driver, targeted by ransomeware, where their attack vector could be supplied with the payload.

>	• Analyze an organization's security controls and compare to compliance regimes

Horrible idea to have any singular system with sweeping access.

>	• Assist developers to create secure by design and secure by default software

Again, Codex problems.

>	• Assist end users to adopt security best practices

I have no idea what this means, it’s completely relative, and the last thing I need as an LLM falsely making people comfortable, telling them they’re making the right decisions, when it could be completely wrong.

AI isn’t like most technologies though. The difference between upgrading legacy software and replacing labor with AI is massive. If a company uses legacy software that’s proven it works and there’s little to no upside to update it, then obviously companies aren’t going to update it. AI has an immense upside, however, and to say that companies won’t be quick to adopt it because they didn’t with some software stacks is not a fair comparison.

As for time estimates, we’re in uncharted territory. The TRUTH is no one REALLY knows so to say “this estimate is wrong it’s actually going to be like this” is pure speculation.

I will say that AI is NOT like any technology we’ve ever created before and an AI revolution isn’t comparable to previous revolutions and history itself. We’ve never created a technology that does everything we can do, we’ve simply made machines that make it easier to do jobs. AI straight up cuts the middleman (humans) out entirely and in doing so creates perverse incentives that can’t be ignored by companies lest they’ll fall behind.

Humanity is transitioning into its next iteration AND it will most likely bi-furcate or even tri-furcate into different species or a contimuum of species. Transhumans will be generally be characterized by the integration of biology and technology including integration with AGI and ASI. A certain portion of the current species will eschew this and decide to remain biologically Human and will return to the Land in agrarian communities based on the best Human principles--a totally legitimate choice that Transhumans will support and respect. Another branch of Humanity will evolve as a result of what we call ""spiritual"" evolution, which is really just an extension of the biological evolutionary process, which will be characterized by a decreasing dependence on external energy sources, long life verging on immortality and mental and psychical abilities.  

The only rub is our current ability to manage the transition with respect for ourselves, each other and the planet. If the current elite are successful at monopolizing the technology to establish a bifurcated Gods-slaves dichotomy, then it could go very badly. I tend to thing this is a bit of an outlier.

Artificial intelligence tutoring outperforms expert instructors in neurosurgical training,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-02-artificial-intelligence-outperforms-expert-instructors.html,"Slightly off topic here but I am really curious as to how effective an AI would be to tutor K12 students in areas such as math, science and other important topics. As it stands computer work in primary schools (work performed by students on a computer based platform as opposed to physical books or writing) is already the primary instrument of learning.

If we had a school system where students sat down for math lectures through a computer platform then an AI instructed said students through both learning the material, asking questions regarding it (not quite ready yet but technologically we are somewhat close), and adjusting the course to best help the student with the material I wonder just how effective it would be.

I imagine something like being in class, with headphones on and interacting through the platform while having both the help of the AI and a teacher for any software/hardware problems or simply to answer questions outside of the scope of the AI as it improves it's teaching methods.

I would love to hear input from you all about this, surely an advancing real time AI that is able to judge your work, adjust the course, and optionally can watch your face through the camera to detect when to give breaks and how much attention is being given.

I guess one point seems to be unclear. This phenomenon does not depend on the architecture per se (number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, activation function), but it depends on the number of degrees of freedom that the model has (number of parameters).  
To me, overfitting seems intuitively better understood by thinking of it as a resonance effect between the degrees of freedom in the model and the number of constraints that the training data imposes. When these two numbers are in the same order of magnitude, the network can solve the problem on the training set (near) perfectly but has to find silly solutions (very large weights, curvy and complex prediction-map). This disrupts the global structure of the prediction-map (or here the prediction curve) and thus corrupts the interpolation effect (where interpolation is necessary to generalise to unseen test data).",3

How would ChatGPT do in this experiment?,/r/ChatGPT/comments/149x2i9/how_would_chatgpt_do_in_this_experiment/,"It can generate things that are somewhat novel, but cannot generate concepts that are absolutely novel from scratch. After all, these things are trained to learn patterns, not create new patterns, so the best you can do right now is blending/mixing patterns to come up with mildly novel things.

In your scenario, it would work poorly. ChatGPT would never be able to come up with major advancements like electricity, for example. Also don't underestimate the amount of science that has never been articulated and proven, but are rather the results of practical experiments and observations. A lot of our tech builds up on stuff we don't understand 100%. ChatGPT can't do practical experiments.

When you start mixing things, however, things can get interesting. For example, combine the concept of **Dynamics** in Game Design patterns in order to describe Dynamics in other completely unrelated domains (e.g. Marketing or Finance), and the output will be an interesting blend of both worlds that occasionally promotes small insights (and lots of craziness) never uttered by any human so far.",8

Right now a movie or a AAA game title is an eight-to-nine-digit investment.  What most people don't realize is that most commercial creative endeavors are *superhuman*.  One guy couldn't do the project by himself; they are iterative, collective efforts.

~~With these new tools, we are essentially a year or two from going from a treatment to a script to an animated, dummy-voiced, shot-for-shot if not full feature without significant human intervention.  Which means you iterate faster and cheaper.~~

Author Edit: Above is unsupported bullsh\*t wrt timeline and capabilities.  Odds of a successful end-to-end in a year or two quite low.  Some of these things *much* harder than others.  Called on same in subsequent comment.

You better be there first, be *really* creative, and good with the tools, otherwise someone will be there faster with something 80% as good, and ready to iterate.

Why do you think Yudkowsky is afraid of AGI systems this much?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/131mccc/why_do_you_think_yudkowsky_is_afraid_of_agi/,"At first glance, this video is just funny: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-lOOUqmyY&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct-lOOUqmyY&)

Then you think about the joke of the programmer who's sent grocery shopping by their partner with the instructions ""Buy a loaf of bread, oh, and check if they have eggs, if they do, buy a dozen."" and the programmer returns with 13 loaves of bread.

Now imagine that a million times more complicated and inscrutable, and way, way faster than a human spreading peanut butter or walking to the store.  

If an AI (and Yudkowsky is talking about a future application, not GPT-4) gets its instruction set or its interpretation of a goal really, really wrong, you won't know about it. Think about how even GPT-4 just hallucinates stuff (and we can't predict what) or how it developed skills we didn't see coming (learning Bengali, for example, or research level chemistry or deceiving a human). Plenty of people in plenty of places are already using GPT-4 for really sensitive stuff (Samsung incident) and ChatGPT-3.5 just received browsing capabilities. It won't be long before someone uses something like AutoGPT aimed at its own code and training material, eager to use our most powerful tool to ""make its own code better"" or something.  

And before you know it, it's made itself better in a way you don't like, but have no way of stopping - because while it's training, you don't even know what abilities or goals it's developing. It's not like you could just stop after each iteration and do a full ""psych eval"", you can't ask it directly, because we already know that it can lie, and we wouldn't even begin to know where to look inside the ""inscrutable matrices"" to understand how it thinks.  

And right now, sure, it's in labs and people are only letting it out after lots and lots of checks (yeah, right) but Elon just bought 15000 gpus to catch up with the rest of the world, surely he'll be super duper careful and try to make something even bigger and better while spending even more time on safety and security? Not to mention all those cryptominers who have plenty of gpus flying around and might just cook some home-baked model in their server room.  

We've got a tool that can make itself better, and this improvement works recursively and retro-actively - you can aim the latest model at older, less powerful models and squeeze more juice out of them. What if you could e.g. use GPT-4 to bring a model anyone could run at home to the full performance of GPT-3.5? What if, in a year or so, everyone could do the same with GPT-4 and use GPT-5 or 6 to make their own GPT-4.5?  


It's basically giving everyone the materials for a self-assembling nuclear something. Could be a power plant, a hover board, or something else, but they all can explode. And if you make enough of them, one will.  


And \*now\* remember that more than half of all AI experts in Silicon Valley believe that there's a 10% chance that AI will wipe us out. Which means you roll a 10-sided die and if you roll a 1, you're dead. How many times do you have to roll until you're certain to get a 1 at least once? How many people are out there rolling?",30

"GPT-4 is not good at the game ""Countdown""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/12g0ysn/gpt4_is_not_good_at_the_game_countdown/,"It successfully found HAIRNETS after I appended the following text to a slightly modified version of your prompt: ""Carefully rearrange the letters showing your working to ensure that no letter is used more than once, and ensuring the selected word is a real and common English word. Write out all the letters to check carefully that each letter is only used once, and make sure the solution is a real English word. Check your answer. If you notice you've made a mistake (you used a letter too many times or the word isn't English), try again with a different, more explicit and careful method.""

Generally speaking, it is better to force GPT-4 to show its working and use this to come to a conclusion, rather than risking a situation where it states an answer immediately. While not foolproof, this method significantly enhances the quality of its outputs.

The way the human brain works is very different from the way these DNN algorithms operate.

Even though there's a great diversity of ""strains"" of different  algorithms they all have their strengths and weaknesses.

All artificial intelligence now is shallow but when humans that are capable are coupled with algorithms there's an incredibly powerful alchemy that takes place.

How to get into an AI career without a CS degree,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/14igxfi/how_to_get_into_an_ai_career_without_a_cs_degree/,"I believe there are two options to get into AI: either build it, or learn to use available tools in your industry. AI will be an essential part in all industries, like marketing for example. If you want to create AI, then learn coding. Start with Python, then dive into ML & Data Science libraries such as numpy, pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Also, learn data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Once you learn all that, start doing real-world projects. Find a real problem around you and solve it.

In the second case scenario, where you want to learn how to use AI within your industry, I advise you to learn skills such as [prompt engineering](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/), and learn how to master ChatGPT and other AI tools. You can take the new [generative AI course from Google (free)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/new-google-cloud-generative-ai-training-resources) to get a general idea about AI. You can learn about and follow AI developments and new tools from [The AI Exchange](https://theaiexchange.com/) and [The Intelligo.](http://www.theintelligo.com)

The resources and paths are limitless, which also means opportunities are limitless. Good luck in your journey!",40
AI trial helps doctors spot early-stage breast cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1455ciz/ai_trial_helps_doctors_spot_earlystage_breast/,"My older brother is going to go specialize in radiology after the summer. It will be interesting to get his opinion on it. From what I remember, radiologists are able to see thousands of shades of gray or something like that, but it definitely sounded like the type of thing AI could eventually help with. 

Reminds me of translation tools that have been around for a while. Translators nowadays tend to feed the text into a program that basically goes through and suggests translations word for word or sentence for sentence, and the professional translator takes on almost more of an editor role than what they used to do in the past. 

I don’t think AI will be fully replacing radiologists, or translators, anytime soon, but I do think it will continue changing those jobs and making them more efficient (removing the total number of jobs needed)",2

Is there any scientific reason to believe that sentience is a function of intelligence?,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/13gqxwu/is_there_any_scientific_reason_to_believe_that/,"Neuroscientist here: “sentience”, like “consciousness“ doesn’t have any agreed upon meeting.  There are a few micro-communities that publish papers and pay themselves on the back (“it saw that we put a ball on its head when looking in the mirror therefore it has an abstract sense of self!”). But most of it is considered garbage by most neuroscientists; we just roll our eyes and hold our tongues because it’s aimed at an audience that’s not us.

That doesn’t mean that there aren’t serious ideas.  What do we consider the ability to think and reason in a way that brings with it ethical obligation?

Is “intelligence” linked to that. That’s another fuzzy word but almost certainly.  The ability to recognize and understand complex patterns *allows* for more complex internal life.  It doesn’t guarantee it, but if the whole world is eat and sleep you might have trouble having opinions on the internal state of others or yourself.

[Integrated Information Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giulio-Tononi/publication/303551101_Integrated_information_theory_From_consciousness_to_its_physical_substrate/links/574f7f7a08aebb988044f5ba/Integrated-information-theory-From-consciousness-to-its-physical-substrate.pdf?origin=publication_detail) is about as close to a serious theory of “sentience”/“consciousness” that I’m aware of.  My mind is on other matters so I’m failing to succeed at creating a digestible blurb right now — ultimately it’s the closest (imo) to a right track example I’ve seen.  Concerning itself with communicating elements and differences in their collective vs individual behavior.

Notably, something like that has certain minimal complexity requirements, but is nominally able to separate our pattern recognition from thought.  (Though there’s a huge bugaboo in how you choose to represent system components!)",26
